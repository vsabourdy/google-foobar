# My Google foobar challenges
Google Foobar challenges are quite good to practice problem solving. If you want to give a try
too, [check this](https://www.google.com/foobar/).

Turns out you need to browse Google's products related to programming to get an invitation. I was looking at the [Google Maps Javascript API documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) before the small pink box appeared in a corner.

Also, if you get an invitation, don't wait until the timeout expires, there is no second try! Don't spend your weekend in the countryside when you start the challenges on Friday's evening like I did, or you'll get "Your invitation has expired. Search on to try again later".
